    My biggest game yet!
    
    Adventure Platformer is a game that is loosely based on Minecraft, but with some modifications
    
    When you save your progress, it saves to localStorage, so you do not need to copy and paste a save file
    
    Since this game uses JS libraries, it is unhackable. If you want to tamper with the code, there is a PJS version of Adventure Platformer at khanacademy.org/cs/a/5866178708455424
    
    This game will have long-term support. To be notified when there are updates, post a single "." in the thread in the T&T

        Other Information:
        A bed sets your spawn point when you place it, and if you have multiple beds, you can set your spawn point to any one of them by pressing SPACEBAR while standing in it
        A portal teleports you back to your spawn point
        Movers only work on normal chests, not stone chests or sea chests
        Fish eggs and shark eggs will spawn fish and sharks, respectively, when placed in water
        Wolves will not attack you until attacked
